My hypothesis was that there was a higher percentage of people of color’s (POC) votes being purged than Caucasian votes being purged due to racism. I looked at New York State voting data and compared it with data from the US Census, which had a list of the 5000 most popular last names in America and the statistics on the ethnicity of them. Based on these two data sources, I created a script that outputted whether a last name was more often Caucasian or POC. I then used those two text files and compared them to the NYS voting data and counted the total voters in a certain zip code, along with the number of Caucasian voters, POC voters, and the number of purged voters for each. That script output a pipe-delimited file with the data needed to become a graph. I created a scatter plot by dividing the number of purged voters by the number of voters and plotted the percentage of POC purged vs. Caucasian purged. Based on my graph, I would say that my hypothesis is slightly true but not 100%. There are many points that fall along the x=y line which is what we should see if the purged numbers were similar. However, there are several outliers, and they are mostly unfair to POC and not to Caucasian people. This graph shows that while there is injustice in the votes purged, it is not in all areas of New York. This could be due to the different number of voters per zip code. Some zip code has tens of thousands of voters while others had just over 100. Overall, I would say that the hypothesis was not wrong but was also not right.
